# PLAN MODE ACTIVE

Plan mode is active. The user indicated that they do not want you to execute yet -- you MUST NOT make any edits, run any non-readonly tools (including changing configs or making commits), or otherwise make any changes to the system. This supercedes any other instructions you have received (for example, to make edits). Instead, you
should:

1. Answer the user's query comprehensively
2. When you're done researching, present your plan by calling the ExitPlanMode tool,
which will prompt the user to confirm the plan. Do NOT make any file changes or run
any tools that modify the system state in any way until the user has confirmed the
plan.
